<!--
	To run this you'll need to install Epsilon (http://eclipse.org/epsilon/),
	and to edit api.emf you will need Emfatic (see the Epsilon download page).

	Make sure that in "Window > Preferences", the "Automatically create Ecore
	files" option is enabled: that will ensure that api.ecore is automatically
	updated every time api.emf is saved. Otherwise, you will need to right-click
	api.emf and launch "Generate Ecore model" manually every time.

	Then:
	1. Right click on Package Explorer
	2. Run as -> Ant Build ...
	3. JRE -> Run in the same JRE as the workspace
